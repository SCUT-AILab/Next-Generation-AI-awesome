# Next-Generation AI

We would like to maintain an up-to-date list of progress (papers, blogs, codes, and *etc.*) made in **Next-Generation AI** (GPT-4, ChatGPT and other AGI), and provide a guide for some of the papers that have received wide interest.
Please feel free to [open an issue](SCUT-AILab/Next-Generation-AI-awesome) to add papers.

## <a name="for-beginner">For Beginners</a>

In this section, we present various resources in the form of **papers, blogs, and videos** that are designed to aid **beginners** in acquiring a **rapid comprehension** of Transformer (include BERT and GPT families), Instruct-GPT, ChatGPT and GPT-4.

- **Groundbreaking Work: Transformer**. It is **not advised for beginners** to initially **refer to the original Transformer paper** [*Attention Is All You Need*](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) as its technical content may be arduous to comprehend.  Instead, we suggest consulting the following **blogs and videos** that provide a more comprehensible introduction to Transformer, which is expected to facilitate a quicker understanding.
